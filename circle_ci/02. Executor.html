<p>
  Executor is environment to run your test.
  It can be 
  - Docker or
  - machine (just a virtual machine)
</p>

<h3>Here is how you define it in .circleci/config.yml</h3>
<script>

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
</script>

<h3>Multiple images</h3>
<p>
  Itâ€™s also possible to specify multiple images. When you do this, all containers 
  will run in a common network. Every exposed port will be available on localhost 
  from a primary container. Example: 
</p>
<script>
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
     - image: buildpack-deps:trusty

     - image: mongo:2.6.8
       command: [mongod, --smallfiles]

    working_directory: ~/

    steps:
      # command will execute in trusty container
      # and can access mongo on localhost
      - run: sleep 5 && nc -vz localhost 27017
</script>
