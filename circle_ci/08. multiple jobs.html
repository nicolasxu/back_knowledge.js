The build job is the default and the only one CircleCI runs automatically. 


Other jobs, you must trigger it yourself. 


Currently, the only way to do that is to use the CircleCI API:

curl -u ${CIRCLE_API_TOKEN}: \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=deploy_production \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/<vcs-type>/<org>/<repo>/tree/master



You can add tokens in circle CI project setting.
