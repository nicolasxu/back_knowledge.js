On CircleCI 2.0 the Docker images you use for you jobs are automatically cached on our infrastructure where possible. 


The caching here is about caching dependency in source code.


To cache a file or folder. 

<script>
- save_cache:
    key: my-cache
    paths:
      - my-file.txt
      - my-project/my-dependencies-directory  

</script>

path for directories is relative to the working_directory of your job.
The libraries the are installed with pip in Python or npm for Node.js should be cached.
