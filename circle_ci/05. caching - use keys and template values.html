myapp-{{ checksum "package.json" }} - cache will be regenerated every time something is changed in package.json file, different branches of this project will generate the same cache key.
myapp-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "package.json" }} - same as the previous one, but each branch will generate separate cache
myapp-{{ epoch }} - every build will generate separate cache
