    steps:
      - run: <do-some-stuff>
      - deploy:
          name: Maybe Deploy
          command: |
            if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "master" ]; then
              <your-deploy-commands>

The most important piece of this example is that weâ€™re checking whether the current branch is the master branch before running any deploy commands
