before running, you need to create a folder for the volume of the jenkins container, or jobs will not saved after container stops. 



step 1:
mkdir jenkins_folder

step 2: (give UID 1000 the ownership of the folder)
chown 1000 jenkins_home

step 3:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /root/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -t jenkins
