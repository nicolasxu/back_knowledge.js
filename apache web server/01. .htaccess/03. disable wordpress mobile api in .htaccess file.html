 WP REST API BLOCK JSON REQUESTS 
# Block/Forbid Requests to: /wp-json/wp/
# WP REST API REQUEST METHODS: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE) [NC]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^.*wp-json/wp/ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F]
A very drastic method, is also to have a 404.html webpage in your root and then add this line:

# WP REST API BLOCK JSON REQUESTS 
# Redirect to a 404.html (you may want to add a 404 header!) 
RewriteRule ^wp-json.*$ 404.html
