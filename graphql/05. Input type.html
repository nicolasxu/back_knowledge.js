All declared variables must be either scalars, enums, or input object types.


So if you want to pass a complex object into a field, you need to know what input type that matches on the server.

<!-- client query -->
<script>
  
mutation CreateReviewForEpisode($ep: Episode!, $review: ReviewInput!) {
  createReview(episode: $ep, review: $review) {
    stars
    commentary
  }
}

</script>

<!-- client variables -->
<script>
  
{
  "ep": "JEDI",
  "review": {
    "stars": 5,
    "commentary": "This is a great movie!"
  }
}  
</script>

<!-- result -->
<script>
  
  {
  "data": {
    "createReview": {
      "stars": 5,
      "commentary": "This is a great movie!"
    }
  }
}
</script>
