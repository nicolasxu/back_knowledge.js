<!-- named query -->
<script>
  
query HeroNameAndFriends($episode: Episode = "JEDI") {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}

</script>

<!-- unnamed query -->
<script>
  

{
  hello(name:"Nicolas Xu")
  services {
    _id
    service_number
   
    price
  }
  service {
    _id
    description
  }
}

</script>


Give query a name
<p>
  
  One thing we also saw in the example above is that our query has acquired an operation name. Up until now, we have been using a shorthand syntax where we omit both the query keyword and the query name, but in production apps it's useful to use these to make our code less ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
  Think of this just like a function name in your favorite programming language. For example, in JavaScript we can easily work only with anonymous functions, but when we give a function a name, it's easier to track it down, debug our code, and log when it's called. In the same way, GraphQL query and mutation names, along with fragment names, can be a useful debugging tool on the server side to identify different GraphQL requests.
