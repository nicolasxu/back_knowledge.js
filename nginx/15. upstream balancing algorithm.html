Changing the Upstream Balancing Algorithm
You can modify the balancing algorithm used by the upstream pool by including directives or flags within the upstream context:

(round robin): The default load balancing algorithm that is used if no other balancing directives are present. Each server defined in the upstream context is passed requests sequentially in turn.


least_conn: Specifies that new connections should always be given to the backend that has the least number of active connections. This can be especially useful in situations where connections to the backend may persist for some time.


ip_hash: This balancing algorithm distributes requests to different servers based on the client's IP address. The first three octets are used as a key to decide on the server to handle the request. The result is that clients tend to be served by the same server each time, which can assist in session consistency.


hash: This balancing algorithm is mainly used with memcached proxying. The servers are divided based on the value of an arbitrarily provided hash key. This can be text, variables, or a combination. This is the only balancing method that requires the user to provide data, which is the key that should be used for the hash.


# http context

upstream backend_hosts {

    least_conn;

    server host1.example.com;
    server host2.example.com;
    server host3.example.com;
}




<!-- example 2 -->

# http context

upstream backend_hosts {

    hash $remote_addr$remote_port consistent;

    server host1.example.com;
    server host2.example.com;
    server host3.example.com;
}
