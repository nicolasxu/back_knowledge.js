The root directive specifies the root directory that will be used to search for a file.
To obtain the path of a requested file, NGINX appends the request URI to the path specified by the root directive.

The directive can be placed on any level within the http, server, or location contexts. 

It applies to all location blocks where the root directive is not included to explicitly redefine the root:


server {
    root /www/data;

    location / {
    }

    location /images/ {
    }

    location ~ \.(mp3|mp4) {
        root /www/media;
    }
}
