# server context

location /match/here {
    proxy_pass http://example.com;
    # proxy_pass 127.0.0.1:3000
}


<p>
  explanation: 

  In the above configuration snippet, no URI is given at the end of the server in the proxy_pass definition. For definitions that fit this pattern, the URI requested by the client will be passed to the upstream server as-is.
