The above request sets the "Host" header to the $host variable, which should contain information about the original host being requested.


 The X-Forwarded-Proto header gives the proxied server information about the schema of the original client request (whether it was an http or an https request).


 The X-Real-IP is set to the IP address of the client so that the proxy can correctly make decisions or log based on this information.


 The X-Forwarded-For header is a list containing the IP addresses of every server the client has been proxied through up to this point. In the example above, we set this to the $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for variable. This variable takes the value of the original X-Forwarded-For header retrieved from the client and adds the Nginx server's IP address to the end.
