Hey Jon,

When accounts first sign up for Amazon SES, they start in the "sandbox". In the sandbox accounts can only send from and to verified email addresses. (You can think of this as: in the sandbox you can only send to yourself.)

When you're ready to use Amazon SES in production, submit a production access request, which is discussed in the Developer Guide. An account with production access may send to unverified To addresses. We respond to production access requests within 24 hours.

Hope this helps,
Justin C.
